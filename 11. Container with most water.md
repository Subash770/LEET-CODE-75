# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the **maximum amount of water** a container can store.

### Constraints
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input:** 
```plaintext
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
```

**Output:** 
```plaintext
49
```

**Explanation:**  
The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

#### Example 2
**Input:** 
```plaintext
height = [1,1]
```

**Output:** 
```plaintext
1
```

## Solution

### Approach
We use the **two-pointer technique** to solve this problem efficiently in \(O(n)\) time.

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - One pointer starts at the beginning (`left`) and the other at the end (`right`) of the array.
2. **Calculate Area**:
   - The area between the two lines is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \min(\text{height[left]}, \text{height[right]}) \times (\text{right} - \text{left})
     \]
3. **Move the Pointer**:
   - To maximize the area, move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue until the two pointers meet, keeping track of the maximum area found.

### Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int maxArea = 0; // Variable to store the maximum area
        int left = 0; // Pointer starting from the leftmost line
        int right = height.length - 1; // Pointer starting from the rightmost line

        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate the current area between the two pointers
            int currentHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int currentWidth = right - left;
            int currentArea = currentHeight * currentWidth;

            // Update the maximum area
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);

            // Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea; // Return the maximum area found
    }
}
```
