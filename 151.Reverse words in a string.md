# 151.Reverse Words in a String
### Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

#### Example 1:

**Input:**
```java
s = "the sky is blue"
```

**Output:**
```java
"blue is sky the"
```

#### Example 2:

**Input:**
```java
s = "  hello world  "
```

**Output:**
```java
"world hello"
```

**Explanation:**
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

#### Example 3:

**Input:**
```java
s = "a good   example"
```

**Output:**
```java
"example good a"
```

**Explanation:**
You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

---

### Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Remove leading and trailing spaces
        s = s.trim();
        
        // Split the string into words by one or more spaces
        String[] words = s.split("\\s++");
        
        // Initialize a StringBuilder to store the result
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        // Iterate over the words array in reverse order
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sb.append(words[i]);
            // Add a space between words, but not after the last word
            if (i > 0) {
                sb.append(" ");
            }
        }
        
        // Convert StringBuilder to a String and return
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
