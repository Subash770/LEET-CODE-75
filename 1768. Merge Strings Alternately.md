# 1768.Merge Strings Alternately

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input**:  
`word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"`  
**Output**:  
`"apbqcr"`  

**Explanation**:  
The merged string will be merged as follows:

#### Example 2
**Input**:  
`word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"`  
**Output**:  
`"apbqrs"`  

**Explanation**:  
Since `word2` is longer, `"rs"` is appended to the end:

#### Example 3
**Input**:  
`word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"`  
**Output**:  
`"apbqcd"`  

**Explanation**:  
Since `word1` is longer, `"cd"` is appended to the end:

### Constraints
- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

Here is the Java solution for merging the strings alternately:

```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder merged = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        // Alternately append characters from both strings
        while (i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()) {
            merged.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            merged.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }

        // Append remaining characters from word1, if any
        while (i < word1.length()) {
            merged.append(word1.charAt(i++));
        }

        // Append remaining characters from word2, if any
        while (j < word2.length()) {
            merged.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }

        return merged.toString();
    }
}
