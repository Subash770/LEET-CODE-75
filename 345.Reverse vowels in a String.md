# 345. Reverse Vowels in a String

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it. 

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`, and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```text
s = "IceCreAm"
```

**Output:**

```text
"AceCreIm"
```

**Explanation:**

The vowels in `s` are `['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']`. On reversing the vowels, `s` becomes `"AceCreIm"`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```text
s = "leetcode"
```

**Output:**

```text
"leotcede"
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= `s.length` <= 3 * 10^5
- `s` consist of printable ASCII characters.

## Approach

We can solve this problem by using a two-pointer approach. We iterate through the string from both ends, looking for vowels. When we find a vowel at both ends, we swap them and move the pointers towards the center.

- Initialize two pointers `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the string.
- Use a string of vowels `vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"` to check for vowels.
- Swap the vowels found at `left` and `right` indices.
- Move the pointers towards each other until they meet.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseVowels(String s) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            // Move left pointer to the next vowel
            while (left < right && vowels.indexOf(chars[left]) == -1) {
                left++;
            }

            // Move right pointer to the previous vowel
            while (left < right && vowels.indexOf(chars[right]) == -1) {
                right--;
            }

            // Swap the vowels
            char temp = chars[left];
            chars[left] = chars[right];
            chars[right] = temp;

            // Move pointers
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        return new String(chars);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

- **Line 2:** Converts the input string `s` into a character array for easier manipulation.
- **Line 3:** Defines the string `vowels` containing all vowels in both lower and upper case.
- **Line 5:** Initializes the `left` pointer at the beginning and `right` pointer at the end of the string.
- **Lines 7-10:** Moves the `left` pointer until it finds a vowel.
- **Lines 12-15:** Moves the `right` pointer until it finds a vowel.
- **Lines 17-20:** Swaps the vowels at the `left` and `right` indices.
- **Line 22:** Converts the character array back to a string and returns it.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each pointer only moves once across the string.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(n)**, as we convert the input string into a character array for manipulation.
