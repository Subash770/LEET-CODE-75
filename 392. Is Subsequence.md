# 392. Is Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"`  
**Output:**  
`true`

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"`  
**Output:**  
`false`

### Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 10 <= t.length <= 10^4
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int sIndex = 0, tIndex = 0;
        
        while (sIndex < s.length() && tIndex < t.length()) {
            // If characters match, move the pointer for s
            if (s.charAt(sIndex) == t.charAt(tIndex)) {
                sIndex++;
            }
            // Always move the pointer for t
            tIndex++;
        }
        
        // If we've traversed all of s, it's a subsequence
        return sIndex == s.length();
    }
}
