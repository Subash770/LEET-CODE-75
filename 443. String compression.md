# 443. String Compression

## Problem Description

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

1. Begin with an empty string `s`.
2. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
   - If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
   - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
3. The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately but instead be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.
4. After modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

### Constraints:
- \( 1 \leq \text{chars.length} \leq 2000 \)
- \( \text{chars}[i] \) is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]`  

**Output:**  
Return `6`, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: `["a","2","b","2","c","3"]`.  

**Explanation:**  
The groups are `"aa"`, `"bb"`, and `"ccc"`. This compresses to `"a2b2c3"`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`chars = ["a"]`  

**Output:**  
Return `1`, and the first character of the input array should be: `["a"]`.  

**Explanation:**  
The only group is `"a"`, which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]`  

**Output:**  
Return `4`, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: `["a","b","1","2"]`.  

**Explanation:**  
The groups are `"a"` and `"bbbbbbbbbbbb"`. This compresses to `"ab12"`.

## Solution 

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int writeIndex = 0; // Index to write the compressed string
        int readIndex = 0;  // Index to read the input array
        
        while (readIndex < chars.length) {
            char currentChar = chars[readIndex];
            int count = 0;
            
            // Count the consecutive repeating characters
            while (readIndex < chars.length && chars[readIndex] == currentChar) {
                readIndex++;
                count++;
            }
            
            // Write the character to the array
            chars[writeIndex++] = currentChar;
            
            // Write the count if greater than 1
            if (count > 1) {
                for (char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) {
                    chars[writeIndex++] = c;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return writeIndex;
    }
}
